This project is a React-based clone of a KFC landing page. 
It showcases various components such as headers, navigation, promotional banners, category sections, and offer cards, mimicking a modern food delivery UI.
The App component imports all child components and assembles the layout.
Offers are displayed using CardApp, and users can scroll left/right with navigation arrows.
Components are styled via styles.css for a user-friendly experience.
Future improvements :Add API integration for dynamic menu items.
Implement cart and checkout functionality.
Enhance responsiveness for mobile devices.
